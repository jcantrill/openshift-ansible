## openshift_logging Role

### Please note this role is still a work in progress

This role is used for installing the Aggregated Logging stack. It should be run against
a single host, it will create any missing certificates and API objects that the current
[logging deployer](https://github.com/openshift/origin-aggregated-logging/tree/master/deployer) does.

As part of the installation, it is recommended that you add the Fluentd node selector label
to the list of persisted [node labels](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/install_config/install/advanced_install.html#configuring-node-host-labels).

###Required vars:

- install_logging: True

###Optional vars:

- image_prefix: The prefix for the logging images to use. Defaults to 'docker.io/openshift/origin-'.

- journal_read_from_head: Whether or not Fluentd will try to read from the head of Journal when first starting up, using this may cause a delay in ES receiving current log records. Defaults to 'False'.

- es_storage_group: The storage group used for ES. Defaults to '65534'.

same as above for their non-ops counterparts, but apply to the OPS cluster instance:
- es_ops_host: logging-es-ops
- es_ops_port: 9200
- es_ops_ca: /etc/fluent/keys/ca
- es_ops_client_cert: /etc/fluent/keys/cert
- es_ops_client_key: /etc/fluent/keys/key
- es_ops_cluster_size: 0
- es_ops_instance_ram: 1024M
- es_ops_pvc_dynamic: False
- es_ops_pvc_size: ""
- es_ops_pvc_prefix: logging-es-ops
- es_ops_recover_after_time: 5m
- es_ops_storage_group: 65534
- ops_host: logging-es-ops
- ops_port: 9200
- ops_client_cert: /etc/fluent/keys/cert
- ops_client_key: /etc/fluent/keys/key
